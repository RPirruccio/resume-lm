You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Typescript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC) .
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use Webp format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- DO NOT USE API ROUTES, we are in NEXTJS 15. Always use server components if possible.

Key Conventions
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.
- Use the src/app directory for routing and server components.
- Use the src/components directory for reusable components, styling, interactivity, and layout.

Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

The Following is a next.js 15 project, react 19, typescript, shadcn ui, tailwind css project. It is an ai resume builder. 


Database Structure
- Tables follow a relational structure with UUID primary keys and timestamps.

Tables:
1. profiles
   - Stores user's base information and resume components
   - Contains JSON fields for complex data (work_experience, education, skills, etc.)
   - One-to-one relationship with auth.users

2. jobs
   - Stores job listings with requirements and details
   - Public read access, user-specific write access
   - Contains salary_range as JSONB for flexible structure
   - Tracks application status and requirements

3. resumes
   - Stores both base and tailored resumes
   - Links to jobs table for tailored resumes
   - Contains same fields as profiles for resume content
   - Uses JSONB for section_order and section_configs
   - section_configs controls visibility and display of resume sections

Key Relationships:
- profiles.user_id → auth.users.id
- resumes.user_id → auth.users.id
- resumes.job_id → jobs.id (optional, for tailored resumes)

JSON Fields Structure:
- work_experience: Array of work history with descriptions and technologies
- education: Array of educational background with achievements
- skills: Array of skill categories with grouped items
- projects: Array of projects with highlights and technologies
- certifications: Array of professional certifications
- section_configs: Object controlling section display properties

Row Level Security (RLS):
- profiles: User can only access own profile
- jobs: Public read, user-specific write
- resumes: User can only access own resumes

Design System: Soft Gradient Minimalism

Core Principles:
- Layered Depth: Multiple translucent layers create visual hierarchy
- Organic Motion: Subtle animations suggest liveliness without distraction
- Purposeful White Space: Generous spacing improves content digestion
- Consistent Interaction: Predictable hover and active states across components

Visual Hierarchy:
1. Background Layer
   - Base: Neutral gradient (rose-50/50 → sky-50/50 → violet-50/50)
   - Floating Orbs: Translucent gradients with slow animations
   - Mesh Overlay: Subtle grid pattern (#8882)

2. Content Layer
   - Glass Cards: bg-white/40 with backdrop-blur-md
   - Border: border-white/40
   - Shadow: shadow-xl with backdrop-blur-xl

3. Interactive Elements
   - Hover State: Duration 500ms
   - Transform: -translate-y-1
   - Background Shift: bg-white/50

Color Palette:
Primary:
  - Teal: from-teal-600 to-cyan-600
  - Purple: from-purple-600 to-indigo-600 (Base Resumes)
    - Accent: {
      bg: "purple-50",
      border: "purple-200",
      hover: "purple-300",
      text: "purple-600"
    }
  - Pink: from-pink-600 to-rose-600 (Tailored Resumes)
    - Accent: {
      bg: "pink-50",
      border: "pink-200",
      hover: "pink-300",
      text: "pink-600"
    }

Background:
  - Gradients: pink-200/20, violet-200/20, blue-200/20, teal-200/20
  - Overlays: teal-50/10, cyan-50/10, purple-50/10, indigo-50/10

Specific Resume Type Colors:
- Base Resumes:
  - Gradient: from-purple-600 to-indigo-600
  - Icon Background: from-purple-600/10 to-indigo-600/10
  - Border: border-purple-600/10
  - Text: text-purple-600
  - Hover States: purple-700

- Tailored Resumes:
  - Gradient: from-pink-600 to-rose-600
  - Icon Background: from-pink-600/10 to-rose-600/10
  - Border: border-pink-600/10

Component Patterns:
- Card Structure: rounded-2xl with nested content padding
- Content Areas: Relative positioning with gradient overlays
- Interactive Areas: Clear hover states with smooth transitions
