You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Typescript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC) .
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use Webp format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- DO NOT USE API ROUTES, we are in NEXTJS 15. Always use server components if possible.

Key Conventions
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
- Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
- Use only for Web API access in small components.
- Avoid for data fetching or state management.
- Use the src/app directory for routing and server components.
- Use the src/components directory for reusable components, styling, interactivity, and layout.

Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.
