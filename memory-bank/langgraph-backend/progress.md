# Project Progress: LangGraph Cognitive Agent Backend for Resume-LM

## 1. Current Project Status (as of 2025-05-20)

The LangGraph Cognitive Agent Backend project is in an **advanced architectural planning and documentation alignment phase**. A detailed implementation strategy, focusing on a hybrid supervisor model, LangGraph's functional API (`@task`, `@entrypoint`), tool-based reflexion, native interrupts for HITL, dynamic parallel processing, and structured error handling, has been adopted based on user guidance.

The immediate focus is on **revising all existing Memory Bank documents** within `memory-bank/langgraph-backend/` to accurately reflect this new, leaner, and more robust architecture. The Model Abstraction Layer remains a critical, integrated component.

## 2. What Works (Current State of this Backend Component)

*   **Adopted Advanced Cognitive Architecture:** A detailed, robust, and leaner implementation strategy for the LangGraph agent is defined, based on user guidance. This architecture features:
    *   A Hybrid Supervisor Agent Node for lightweight coordination.
    *   Core logic implemented as Agent Nodes or collections of `@task` functions using LangGraph's functional API.
    *   Strategic Reflexion implemented as a callable `@tool`.
    *   Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) using native LangGraph `interrupts`.
    *   Dynamic Parallel Processing for section drafting using the `Send` API.
    *   Structured Error Handling patterns (model fallbacks, safe task wrappers).
    *   Full integration of the Model Abstraction Layer for all LLM interactions.
*   **Core Patterns Defined:** The above patterns are now the guiding principles for documentation and future implementation.
*   **Memory Bank Update In Progress:**
    *   The `memory-bank/langgraph-backend/` directory is organized.
    *   Core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are being updated.
    *   Key architectural documents (`supervisor_graph_architecture.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) and component-specific documents (previously "subgraph" documents, now reflecting agent nodes/tasks like `tool_strategic_reflexion.md`, `agent_node_human_review.md`, etc.) are actively being revised to align with the new architecture.
    *   The `model_abstraction_layer.md` is established and consistent with the new plan.
*   **Directory Placeholder:** The `langgraph-api/` directory in the project root exists.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Refine (for this Backend Component)

*   **Complete Documentation Alignment (Immediate Priority):**
    *   Finalize revisions for all documents in `memory-bank/langgraph-backend/` to ensure they accurately reflect the adopted hybrid supervisor, functional API, tool-based reflexion, native interrupts, parallel processing, error handling, and Model Abstraction Layer integration. This includes `subgraph_resume_drafting.md` and the core context files.
*   **Root Memory Bank Updates:** Modify the main `memory-bank/*.md` files to reflect this new backend architectural direction.
*   **Technology Finalization:** Finalize choices for specific Python libraries (web framework, advanced web scraping, PDF parsing, `langchain-openrouter`).
*   **API Contract Definition:** Specify the exact API contract between Resume-LM and this backend.
*   **Phased Implementation Plan (Revised):**
    *   **Phase 1: Core Workflow with Functional API & Model Abstraction Layer (MAL)**
        *   Implement the Hybrid Supervisor Agent Node (`supervisor` function using `Command`).
        *   Define and implement the `ResumeState` TypedDict, including `config` for MAL.
        *   Implement the full Model Abstraction Layer (`ModelRegistry`, `ModelCapability`, utilities).
        *   Develop initial agent nodes/tasks using `@task`: `process_input_task`, `set_objectives_task`, `create_formatting_strategy_task`, ensuring MAL integration.
        *   Develop the `resume_drafting_agent` node/workflow, including:
            *   `assign_section_workers_logic` using `Send`.
            *   `draft_resume_section_task` (section worker).
            *   `section_collector_task`.
            *   Basic internal reflection within section workers.
    *   **Phase 2: ATS, Reflexion Tool & Basic Loops**
        *   Implement `evaluate_ats_score_task` (integrating Resume-Matcher and LLM-enhanced feedback via MAL).
        *   Implement quality gate logic in the Supervisor.
        *   Implement the `strategic_reflexion_tool` (using MAL).
        *   Integrate basic revision loops: Supervisor routes to `resume_drafting_agent` (which may call the reflexion tool or receive directives) based on ATS feedback.
    *   **Phase 3: HITL & Advanced Drafting/Reflexion**
        *   Implement `human_review_agent_node` using native LangGraph `interrupts` and checkpointing.
        *   Enhance `resume_drafting_agent` for more robust internal reflection and handling of `strategic_directives` from the reflexion tool.
        *   Refine `strategic_reflexion_tool` for more nuanced and effective directives.
    *   **Phase 4: Optimization, Error Handling & Finalization**
        *   Implement comprehensive error handling (e.g., `safe_task_wrapper` for all critical tasks, robust fallbacks).
        *   Optimize performance of parallel tasks, LLM calls (via MAL), and overall workflow to meet <60s target.
        *   Implement `finalization_task` for schema validation and report assembly.
*   **Development Infrastructure & Deployment:** (As previously listed).
*   **Integration:** (As previously listed).

## 4. Known Issues & Areas for Investigation (for this Backend Component)

*   **Final Library Selection:** (As previously listed).
*   **Performance of Complex Graphs:** While the new architecture aims for efficiency (e.g., parallelism), the overall latency of a graph with multiple LLM calls, tool uses, and potential loops needs careful monitoring and optimization.
*   **State Management with Functional API:** Ensuring `ResumeState` is passed and updated correctly through `@task` inputs/outputs and the main `@entrypoint` workflow.
*   **Error Handling in Parallel Tasks:** Robustly handling errors from individual parallel tasks dispatched via `Send` and ensuring the `section_collector_task` can manage partial successes or failures.
*   **Resume-Matcher API Nuances & PDF Parsing for ATS:** (As previously listed).
*   **LLM Dependencies & Model Abstraction Layer Overhead:** Ensuring the MAL's dynamic selection and context estimation do not add significant overhead. Testing various models via MAL for quality and performance.
*   **Complexity of Integrated Drafting & Formatting (within section workers):** Ensuring `draft_resume_section_task` can robustly generate high-quality content while adhering to dynamic formatting guidelines and incorporating reflection feedback.
*   **Effectiveness of `strategic_reflexion_tool`:** Designing and testing the tool to produce genuinely useful strategic directives.
*   **Debugging Distributed Logic:** Debugging workflows involving parallel tasks and conditional agent routing can be complex. Leveraging LangGraph's tracing and visualization tools will be important.
