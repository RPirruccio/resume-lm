# Project Progress: ResumeLM

## 1. Current Project Status (as of 2025-05-21)

The ResumeLM project is in an active development phase. **An AI schema validation error in `formatJobListing` (related to enum casing, unexpected array types, and empty strings) has been resolved.** Enterprise limitations on resume creation were also removed, and client-side ID generation for AI-tailored resumes was implemented.

Recent completions include:
*   Fix for AI schema validation error in `formatJobListing` by making `simplifiedJobSchema` more robust to AI output variations for `work_location` (handling arrays, casing, and empty strings) and `employment_type` (handling "contractor", casing, and empty strings).
*   Removal of enterprise limitations on resume creation.
*   Implementation of client-side ID generation for AI resume tailoring.
*   Integration of AI-generated professional summaries into the tailoring flow.
*   Fixes for PDF rendering of `location` fields.
*   Implementation and refinement of the manual "Professional Summary" section UI and PDF rendering.
*   Establishment of a new development strategy (in `.clinerules/development-strategy.md`) to decouple frontend AI enhancements from LangGraph backend development.

The planning and documentation for the new LangGraph backend continue in parallel.

## 2. What Works

*   **User Authentication & Basic Profile Management.**
*   **Database Schema & Migrations.**
*   **AI Model Integration (Vercel AI SDK):**
    *   Connection to various LLMs.
    *   API key management and model selection UI.
*   **AI Resume Tailoring (Vercel AI SDK - Enhanced):**
    *   The `tailorResumeToJob` action in `src/utils/actions/jobs/ai.ts` generates tailored resume content based on `simplifiedResumeSchema`.
    *   **Client-Side ID Generation:** The output of `tailorResumeToJob` is now processed by `addClientSideIdsToAiResumeOutput` (in `src/utils/data-transformation.ts`) to add unique IDs to sections and transform string arrays (descriptions, skill items) into `DescriptionPoint[]` objects with IDs.
    *   **Professional Summary Integration:** The `professional_summary` generated by the AI is included in the processed content and saved to the database via the `createTailoredResume` action.
    *   System prompt `TAILORED_RESUME_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` is in place for content quality, including summary generation.
    *   `simplifiedResumeSchema` in `src/lib/zod-schemas.ts` includes `professional_summary`.
*   **PDF Generation:**
    *   The `ResumePDFDocument` component renders resume data.
*   **Core UI Components & DND Functionality:** Implemented for major sections. (Assumed to be working with new ID structure, pending testing).
*   **TDD Setup:** Functional for `tailorResumeToJob`.
*   **Manual Professional Summary Feature:** UI, data storage, PDF rendering, and live preview are functional.

## 3. What's Left to Build / Refine

*   **Testing of Recent Changes:**
    *   Thoroughly test the "create new tailored resume" feature end-to-end to ensure the schema validation fix works, unlimited creation is active, and ID generation/summary features function as expected.
    *   Verify "unique key prop" errors remain resolved.
    *   Confirm professional summary and all sections render correctly.
    *   Check DND functionality.
*   **LangGraph Cognitive Agent Backend Development (Parallel Major Initiative):**
    *   (All previously listed phases: Planning, Core Implementation, ATS, HITL, Optimization, Infrastructure).
*   **Integration of LangGraph Backend (Future):** Replacing Vercel AI SDK calls for tailoring.
*   **Frontend Enhancements (Deferred/Minor):**
    *   DND for "Key Achievements/Coursework" within education cards.
    *   Verify DND for "Professional Summary" section in `EditorPanel`.
    *   Ensure default `section_configs` for `professional_summary` are handled.
*   **Full Resume Editing Experience (Ongoing).**
*   **Job Listings Feature (Ongoing).**
*   **Cover Letter Feature (Future).**
*   **Comprehensive Testing (Expanding TDD).**
*   **Design System Polish.**
*   **Error Handling and User Feedback.**
*   **Subscription Management.**

## 4. Known Issues & Areas for Investigation

*   **LLM Content Quality & Relevance (Vercel AI SDK & Future LangGraph):** Ongoing focus.
*   (Other existing known issues like Zod/TS discrepancies, `jobs` table definition, ESLint errors remain).

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **AI Schema Validation Fix for Enums, Types, and Empty Strings (2025-05-21):**
    *   Refined `z.preprocess()` in `simplifiedJobSchema` in `src/lib/zod-schemas.ts` for `work_location` and `employment_type` to correctly handle empty strings by converting them to `null` before enum validation, in addition to handling array inputs and casing/value variations.
*   **Enterprise Limitation Removal (2025-05-21):**
    *   Modified `src/app/page.tsx` to set `canCreateBase` and `canCreateTailored` to `true` unconditionally.
*   **Client-Side ID Generation & Summary Integration (2025-05-21):**
    *   Implemented `addClientSideIdsToAiResumeOutput` utility.
    *   Integrated into `create-tailored-resume-dialog.tsx`.
    *   Updated `createTailoredResume` action to accept ID-enriched content.
*   **Development Strategy Shift (Prior to ID generation task):** Decided to implement AI professional summary using the existing Vercel AI SDK first.
*   **AI Professional Summary Setup (Prior to current task):**
    *   Updated `simplifiedResumeSchema` to include `professional_summary`.
    *   Updated `TAILORED_RESUME_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_MESSAGE` for summary generation.
*   (Previous evolution points regarding AI Model, PDF, TDD, Zod, LangGraph shift, Data Structure, DND, Manual Summary, Location Rendering remain relevant historical context).

This document will be updated regularly to reflect the project's progress, new challenges, and evolving solutions.
